# Post 004: Drawing with Deformed Circles

Composition using the self defined shape [DeformedLayeredCircle](../libs/README.md#shapes). These deformed circles are based on a set of closed paths that follow a circle structure changing the radius lengh for each resolution step.

The piece is inspired by the comic artist [72kilos](http://www.72kilos.com/).

# Post 011: Mixed Composition with Textures

This animation is a cocktail of different data and techniques that I wanted to combine and experiment with. The main components of the program are:
- The background: a static primitive plane textured with an imported background image trough the pair of shaders `shaders/background_image`.
- The scene: two rotating 3D models textured through the pair of shaders `shaders/pierrextardif_plastic`.

The data:
- Background image: made with [Procreate](https://procreate.art/)
- 3D model of the number one: made with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
- Shaders used to texture the 3D models: from the addon [ofxPlasticTexture](https://github.com/pierrextardif/ofxPlasticTexture) by Pierre Tardif

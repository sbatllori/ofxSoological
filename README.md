# ofxSoological

This is a personal project to learn how to code generative art with [openframeworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) in C++. The intention is to regularly post a new app to render an animation or image. In this repo you can find the source code of regular openframeworks app, namely the `ofApp.h` and `ofApp.cpp` class implementation scripts. Check out [@soo.logical](https://www.instagram.com/soo.logical/) on Instagram to see the results & more!
